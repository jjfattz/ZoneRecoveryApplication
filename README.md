Business context

The end objective for this project was to utilize IG’s public API and design the application to enable clients to create a watch list of markets with a very high volatility which will allow them to place trades, monitor their open positions, constantly see an updated account balance and show their profit or loss over the period. This application will also provide a unique service that allows the user to automatically hedge a bet, if the trade is losing, using the zone recovery algorithm. This project, when completed, will give clients another tool which will enhance their trading experience, provide more features to the trading platform as well as making IG a profit as they take commission on every trade. The main objectives are to create a realistic, efficient plan detailing each step needed to make the project a success, to meet the customer’s needs & requirement and finally to make IG’s trading platform a better experience for clients.
